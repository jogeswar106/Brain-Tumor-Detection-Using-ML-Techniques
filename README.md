# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-ML-Techniques


This project, titled Brain Tumor Detection Using ML ," employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors in MRI images. 
Building upon this successful detection system, we propose to enhance patient care by integrating geolocation services. 
Upon tumor detection, users' latitude and longitude will be utilized to pinpoint their location. Leveraging this data, nearby doctors specializing in brain tumors will be identified, facilitating prompt medical attention. 
This integration of CNN-based diagnosis with geolocation services streamlines the process of accessing specialized healthcare, potentially improving patient outcomes and overall healthcare efficiency.
